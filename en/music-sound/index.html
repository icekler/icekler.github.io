<h2>Wind Instruments</h2>

<p>I have a wide range of musical tastes and hobbies. I like composing music in digital software. I have a few old compositions for a rock album that I never finished, and I did videogame music for a game that never quite released. However, most of the time I enjoy playing music, I have around 5 ocarinas, 3 quenas, 2 zampo√±as, an Irish tin-whistle, and a few miscellaneous traditional flutes. I also quite enjoy just whistling and blowing on bottles. I've participated in musical ensembles with my ocarina and quena before, but few were recorded in good quality.</p>

<h2>Bandcamp - My music</h2>

<p>I use Bandcamp to upload my music, give it a listen, or visit me at <a href="https://icekler.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp: Icekler</a>.</p>

<p>My latest release was the OST for a videogame that wasn't released.</p>
<p>It was made in May 2015.</p>
<p>Give it a listen below:</p>

<p>I also had an incomplete rock music album back in February 2013. As unfinished as it is, give it a listen.</p>
