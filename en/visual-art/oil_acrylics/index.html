    <h2>International Baccalaureate Art class</h2>

    <p>During High School, I took art classes in the IB courses. My theme was Dragons and Escape from Reality. These are some of my oldest paintings, and the main theme and style of my current art is different now, but I leave these as evidence of my growth.</p>
