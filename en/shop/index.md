# Shop / Prints / Commissions

Welcome to my shop! I've only started, so for the moment I'm only selling prints and commissions, but as soon as I start getting the hang of it I want to include a variety of items! If you have any specific requests that aren't just wall art (for example teacups, shirts, stickers, etc), please let me know and we'll figure it out together. Click down the table of contents for details.

There isn't an automated online storefront so all requests must be made by email or message to me, payment forms will be sent upon an agreement has been made.

[**Send art print requests (currently open!)**](mailto:icekler.art.requests@gmail.com) and [**inquiries for commissions (currently open!)**](mailto:icekler.art.requests@gmail.com) to:[icekler.art.requests@gmail.com](mailto:icekler.art.requests@gmail.com)

You can also contact me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/icekler/), which is where I'm the most active.

## Prints

For printing I'm currently using two services: [Printful](https://www.printful.com) and [Graphic.jp](https://www.graphic.jp/). They both have pros and cons, so I'll list them in [Printful.com details](#printfulcom-details) and in [Graphic.jp details](#graphicjp-details).

<a id="pricing-scheme"></a>
### Pricing scheme

In a nutshell, my pricing is calculated like this:

```
Total Price = Order cost + Shipping cost + Labor cost
```

The order cost depends on what quality, size, and extra content is included in the order. I do not control this, but rather it's the cost of using [Printful.com](https://www.printful.com) and [Graphic.jp](https://www.graphic.jp/) to do the print.  
The shipping cost is calculated by Printful.com or Graphic.jp to Japan so I can bundle a letter or sign the piece, adding to that the cost of shipping with Japan Post, since I'll be doing the shipping myself.  

The labor cost for wall art display prints is as follows:

| Piece type | Labor cost in JPY | USD (approximated) |
|---|---|---|
| Calligraphy | **16,000 JPY** | (103.99 USD) |
| Ink, watercolor, acrylics paintings | **50,000 JPY** | (324.96 USD) |
| Large scale paintings | **100,000 JPY** | (649.92 USD) |

**For pieces that are not commissions, I do not sell originals.**



The labor cost for post card size, small items, small scale prints is as follows:

| Piece type | Labor cost in JPY | USD (approximated) |
|---|---|---|
| Calligraphy | **2,500 JPY** | (16.25 USD) |
| Ink, watercolor, acrylics paintings | **5,000 JPY** | (32.50 USD) |
| Large scale paintings | **12,000 JPY** | (77.99 USD) |

***Payment is requested via PayPal after the order is consolidated***

<a id="commissions-for-personal-use"></a>
## Commissions for personal use

I'm also open for commissions! Say you want an avatar for your social media, or perhaps a very interesting calligraphy, or a specific painting that you have in mind would look good if I painted it. 

If you need a commission for purposes that can be considered as commercial (e.g. a small business, online creator, etc.) and have different needs that don't match the license or copyright limitations, a different contract and pricing can be negotiated.

Commission prices are calculated as follows:

```
Commission Price = Order cost (digital delivery is free) + Shipping Cost (digital delivery is free) + Labor Cost
```


| Piece type | Labor cost in JPY | USD (approximated) |
|---|---|---|
| Calligraphy, short message | **4,000 JPY** | (26.02 USD) |
| Calligraphy, long message | **8,000 JPY** | (52.04 USD) |
| Doodle / sketch (small scale) | **10,000 JPY** | (64.99 USD) |
| Ink, watercolor, acrylics paintings (normal scale) | **50,000 JPY** | (324.96 USD) |
| Large scale paintings | **150,000 JPY** | (974.88 USD) |
| Original (normal scale) (add-on fee) | **150,000 JPY** | (974.88 USD) |
| Large scale original (add-on fee) | **300,000 JPY** | (1949.76 USD) |


<a id="terms-and-conditions"></a>
### Terms and Conditions

In order to request a commission the following terms and conditions must be accepted.

Payment for commissions needs to be made upfront after reaching an agreement on the piece. Changes posterior to payment are subject to negotiation within reason, and might be or might not be cause for extra charges or partial cancellations depending on the request.

I retain the right to change pricing before or during negotiation but not after payment in exception to changes posterior to payment in the requested piece as stated above.

I retain the right to refuse any commission request for any reason, and while I list some subjects fit for rejection, others may apply.

Clients must be of age 18 or above. 

I retain the right to cancel any ongoing commission due to any personal reasons (e.g. health or scheduling issues) and a refund will be given in such cases. 

In the case that order and shipping costs have already been incurred and a cancellation happens due to circumstances on the client side, some costs might not be able to be refunded and a partial delivery will be negotiated.

Harmful, disrespectful, or offensive interactions with me, as well as interactions that jeopardize my safety, will result in an immediate cancellation of any ongoing commission without refund.

Commissions earned through membership to loyalty programs will be subject to terms and conditions detailed in such programs and specific clauses might supersede the ones stated here, and are not subject to refunds in the same manner.

I will most likely, but not necessarily accept commissions of the following subjects:

- Humans
- Animals
- Nature
- Furries
- Folklore and fantasy creatures
- Non-mainstream religious imagery
- Nudity (artistic)
- Nudity (sexualized)
- Body diversity (within reason)
- Gender diversity
- Sexual subjects (educational)
- Sexual subjects (erotic)
- Blood (non-sexual subjects only)
- Fetish content (exceptions to my taste)

I will most likely reject the following subjects:

- Offensive, Harmful or Discriminatory subjects
- Mainstream religious imagery
- Egregious or detailed fetishized gore
- Fetish content relating to age, scat, gore, or body size
- Material that promotes ideologies that I do not agree with
- Material that requires a style that is different to mine or resembling another artist
- Material that might result in copyright issues


<a id="license"></a>
### License

The license applied to commissions within the above terms ensures the client capacity to decide who has permissions to share or adapt the piece, as long as the usage is for non-commercial purposes only, proper attribution is made when shared publicly, and derivatives of the piece retain the same terms.

The client, and any non-commercial entities given express permission by the client are further referred to as "users". Other persons the material has been distributed to but not given express permission by the client cannot share or adapt the material.

Users have the right to:

**Share** — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format

**Adapt** — remix, transform, and build upon the material

I cannot revoke these freedoms as long as the users follow the license terms. I can update or modify the terms of the license if deemed necessary.

Users must abide by the following terms:

**Attribution** — Users must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license where appropriate, and indicate if changes were made if the work is shared publicly. Users may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests I endorse the users or their use. 

**NonCommercial** — Users may not use the material for commercial purposes.

**ShareAlike** — If users remix, transform, or build upon the material, users must distribute their contributions under the same license as the original.

**Tasteful** — If users share or adapt the material, the material may not be shared in a way that becomes harmful, offensive or discriminatory.

I retain the right to share or adapt the material, except upon negotiation and agreement with the client.

Commercial entities given express permission by the client to share or adapt the piece must only do so for the purpose of the specific request of the client and not any other purpose (for example, online social media platforms sharing the piece must not share or adapt it in any way not expressly allowed by the users or artist).

Use for AI training is strictly forbidden.

Commissions under these terms and conditions and license are to be requested for non-commercial use only. Creators or small businesses might request commissions under a newly negotiated contract with different pricing schemes, usage stipulations and ownership rights outside of the scope of this document.
