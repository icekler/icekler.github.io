## Prints

For printing I'm currently using two services: [Graphic.jp](https://www.graphic.jp/) and [Printpac.co.jp](https://www.printpac.co.jp/). They both have pros and cons, so I'll list them in [Printpac.co.jp details](#printfulcom-details) and in [Graphic.jp details](#graphicjp-details).

<a id="pricing-scheme-wall-art"></a>
### Pricing scheme (wall art)

In a nutshell, my pricing is calculated like this:

```
Total Price = Order cost + Labor cost + Shipping cost
```

The order cost depends on what quality, size, and materials I need to fulfill the order. I do not control this, but rather it's the cost of sending the painting to print, or to frame it if it is printed in a material that needs framing. It ranges from 2500 to 3500 JPY for regular sized prints. Larger prints might incur further costs.  

I can bundle a letter or sign the piece. Once bundled, I add the cost of shipping with Japan Post, since I'll be doing the shipping myself.  

The labor cost for wall art display prints is as follows:


| Piece type | Painting Category | Sale type | Labor cost in JPY | Labor cost (USD approximated) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Self made | Ink painting mini |  original | 2,000 JPY | (13.40 USD) |
| Self made | Watercolor mini |  original | 3,000 JPY | (20.10 USD) |
| Self made | Calligraphy mini |  original | 1,280 JPY | (8.58 USD) |
| Self made | Ink painting mini |  print | 280 JPY | (1.88 USD) |
| Self made | Ink painting small |  print | 4,000 JPY | (26.80 USD) |
| Self made | Ink painting big |  print | 5,500 JPY | (36.85 USD) |
| Self made | Watercolor mini |  print | 280 | (1.88 USD) |
| Self made | Watercolor small |  print | 6,000 JPY | (40.20 USD) |
| Self made | Watercolor big |  print | 12,000 JPY | (80.40 USD) |
| Self made | Calligraphy mini |  print | 280 | (1.88 USD) |
| Self made | Calligraphy small |  print | 2,560 JPY | (17.15 USD) |
| Self made | Calligraphy big |  print | 5,120 JPY | (34.30 USD) |
| Commission | Ink painting mini |  original | 2,500 JPY | (16.75 USD) |
| Commission | Ink painting small |  original | 12,500 JPY | (83.75 USD) |
| Commission | Ink painting big |  original | 17,188 JPY | (115.16 USD) |
| Commission | Watercolor mini |  original | 3,750 JPY | (25.13 USD) |
| Commission | Watercolor small |  original | 18,750 JPY | (125.63 USD) |
| Commission | Watercolor big |  original | 37,500 JPY | (251.25 USD) |
| Commission | Calligraphy mini |  original | 1,600 JPY | (10.72 USD) |
| Commission | Calligraphy small |  original | 8,000 JPY | (53.60 USD) |
| Commission | Calligraphy big |  original | 16,000 JPY | (107.20 USD) |
| Commission | Ink painting mini |  print | 700 JPY | (4.69 USD) |
| Commission | Ink painting small |  print | 5,000 JPY | (33.50 USD) |
| Commission | Ink painting big |  print | 6,875 JPY | (46.06 USD) |
| Commission | Watercolor mini |  print | 700 JPY | (4.69 USD) |
| Commission | Watercolor small |  print | 7,500 JPY | (50.25 USD) |
| Commission | Watercolor big |  print | 15,000 JPY | (100.50 USD) |
| Commission | Calligraphy mini |  print | 700 JPY | (4.69 USD) |
| Commission | Calligraphy small |  print | 3,200 JPY | (21.44 USD) |
| Commission | Calligraphy big |  print | 6,400 JPY | (42.88 USD) |

**Commission refers to the work being commissioned directly to me. Printing copies of commissions made by other people is done at the "self made" price"**

**For pieces that are not commissions, I do not sell originals except for postcard (mini) sized.**

***Payment is requested via PayPal after the order is consolidated***

### Pricing scheme (merch)

For merch, since I will be printing in batches, has no order cost, but only labor cost and shipping cost associated with it.

```
Total Price = Labor cost + Shipping cost
```

The labor cost for post card size, small items, small scale prints is as follows:

| Piece type | Painting Category | Sale type | Labor cost in JPY | Labor cost (USD approximated) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Self made | Postcard |  print | 280 JPY | (1.88 USD) |
| Self made | Rainbow holo sticker 50mm2 |  print sticker 50mm2 | 420 JPY | (2.81 USD) |
| Commission (add to lineup) | Postcard |  print | 700 JPY | (4.69 USD) |
| Commission (add to lineup) | Rainbow holo sticker 50mm2 |  print sticker 50mm2 | 1200 JPY | (8.04 USD) |

**Commission refers to the work being commissioned directly to me. Printing copies of commissions made by other people is done at the "self made" price"**

**Sticker commissions need to be paid as regular art commissions first**

**Commissions at this price scheme are agreed to be available for sale for other people.** If a private commission where the merch will be unique and not for sale to others after purchase, the order cost is added:

```
Total Price = Order cost + Labor cost + Shipping cost
```

| Piece type | Painting Category | Sale type | Labor cost in JPY | Labor cost (USD approximated) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Commission (private) | Postcard |  print / digital | 700 JPY | (4.69 USD) |
| Commission (private) | Rainbow holo sticker 50mm2 |  print sticker 50mm2 | 1200 JPY | (8.04 USD) |


***Payment is requested via PayPal after the order is consolidated***

## Commissions for personal use

I'm also open for commissions! Say you want an avatar for your social media, or perhaps a very interesting calligraphy, or a specific painting that you have in mind would look good if I painted it. 

If you need a commission for purposes that can be considered as commercial (e.g. a small business, online creator, etc.) and have different needs that don't match the license or copyright limitations, a different contract and pricing can be negotiated.

Commission prices are calculated as follows:

```
Commission Price = Order cost (digital delivery is free) + Shipping Cost (digital delivery is free) + Labor Cost
```


| Piece type | Painting Category | Sale type | Labor cost in JPY | Labor cost (USD approximated) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Commission | Ink painting mini |  original | 2,500 JPY | (16.75 USD) |
| Commission | Ink painting small |  original | 12,500 JPY | (83.75 USD) |
| Commission | Ink painting big |  original | 17,188 JPY | (115.16 USD) |
| Commission | Watercolor mini |  original | 3,750 JPY | (25.13 USD) |
| Commission | Watercolor small |  original | 18,750 JPY | (125.63 USD) |
| Commission | Watercolor big |  original | 37,500 JPY | (251.25 USD) |
| Commission | Calligraphy mini |  original | 1,600 JPY | (10.72 USD) |
| Commission | Calligraphy small |  original | 8,000 JPY | (53.60 USD) |

### Terms and Conditions

In order to request a commission the following terms and conditions must be accepted.

Payment for commissions needs to be made upfront after reaching an agreement on the piece. Changes posterior to payment are subject to negotiation within reason, and might be or might not be cause for extra charges or partial cancellations depending on the request.

I retain the right to change pricing before or during negotiation but not after payment in exception to changes posterior to payment in the requested piece as stated above.

I retain the right to refuse any commission request for any reason, and while I list some subjects fit for rejection, others may apply.

Clients must be of age 18 or above. 

I retain the right to cancel any ongoing commission due to any personal reasons (e.g. health or scheduling issues) and a refund will be given in such cases. 

In the case that order and shipping costs have already been incurred and a cancellation happens due to circumstances on the client side, some costs might not be able to be refunded and a partial delivery will be negotiated.

Harmful, disrespectful, or offensive interactions with me, as well as interactions that jeopardize my safety, will result in an immediate cancellation of any ongoing commission without refund.

Commissions earned through membership to loyalty programs will be subject to terms and conditions detailed in such programs and specific clauses might supersede the ones stated here, and are not subject to refunds in the same manner.

I will most likely, but not necessarily accept commissions of the following subjects:

- Humans
- Animals
- Nature
- Furries
- Folklore and fantasy creatures
- Non-mainstream religious imagery
- Nudity (artistic)
- Nudity (sexualized)
- Body diversity (within reason)
- Gender diversity
- Sexual subjects (educational)
- Sexual subjects (erotic)
- Blood (non-sexual subjects only)
- Fetish content (exceptions to my taste)

I will most likely reject the following subjects:

- Offensive, Harmful or Discriminatory subjects
- Mainstream religious imagery
- Egregious or detailed fetishized gore
- Fetish content relating to age, scat, gore, or body size
- Material that promotes ideologies that I do not agree with
- Material that requires a style that is different to mine or resembling another artist
- Material that might result in copyright issues


<a id="license"></a>
### License

The license applied to commissions within the above terms ensures the client capacity to decide who has permissions to share or adapt the piece, as long as the usage is for non-commercial purposes only, proper attribution is made when shared publicly, and derivatives of the piece retain the same terms.

The client, and any non-commercial entities given express permission by the client are further referred to as "users". Other persons the material has been distributed to but not given express permission by the client cannot share or adapt the material.

Users have the right to:

**Share** — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format

**Adapt** — remix, transform, and build upon the material

I cannot revoke these freedoms as long as the users follow the license terms. I can update or modify the terms of the license if deemed necessary.

Users must abide by the following terms:

**Attribution** — Users must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license where appropriate, and indicate if changes were made if the work is shared publicly. Users may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests I endorse the users or their use. 

**NonCommercial** — Users may not use the material for commercial purposes.

**ShareAlike** — If users remix, transform, or build upon the material, users must distribute their contributions under the same license as the original.

**Tasteful** — If users share or adapt the material, the material may not be shared in a way that becomes harmful, offensive or discriminatory.

I retain the right to share or adapt the material, except upon negotiation and agreement with the client.

Commercial entities given express permission by the client to share or adapt the piece must only do so for the purpose of the specific request of the client and not any other purpose (for example, online social media platforms sharing the piece must not share or adapt it in any way not expressly allowed by the users or artist).

Use for AI training is strictly forbidden.

Commissions under these terms and conditions and license are to be requested for non-commercial use only. Creators or small businesses might request commissions under a newly negotiated contract with different pricing schemes, usage stipulations and ownership rights outside of the scope of this document.

## Payments and Donations

***Payment is requested via PayPal after the order is consolidated***

I will make a payment request on PayPal personally via e-mail once the order is finished. If you use a credit card and don't have a PayPal account, you can instead pay through Ko-Fi

***DO NOT PAY BEFORE THE ORDER IS CONFIRMED***

I also accept donations, if you'd like to buy me a coffee, lunch, or just help me with my dream of being a self-supported artist! 🥰 

You can [donate for art supplies on Ko-Fi!](https://ko-fi.com/icekler)
