## Who am I?

I'm Claire, a Mexican queer transgender woman, artist, and martial artist living in Japan, and I intend to normalize LGBTQ+, mental health, neurodiversity, intimate relationship style diversity and sex education. As an artist, I do visual art, music, martial arts, poetry, and so on. Lately I prefer to use ink as my main medium, and I've begun to do a little bit more of hand-crafts and watercolor. I go on Instagram and other social media accounts by [@icekler](https://www.instagram.com/icekler/)

## What do I do?

Aside from my day job, in my free time, I am also an artist, I mainly use ink on paper and watercolor, but I have used digital mediums in the past, such as digital painting, vector illustration designing, 3D modeling, 3D animation, 2D animation, etc. I also enjoy handcrafting, wood carving and other manual arts.

Aside from the visual arts, I also do many martial arts, I've done Aikido my whole life, while recently I also do Karate and Yoga in my free time. However I've also practiced Kendo, Shorinji-Kenpo, Judo and I would like to join archery and Kyudo in the future.

I also have a wide range of musical tastes and hobbies. I like composing music in digital software. I have a few old compositions for a rock album that I never finished, and I did video game music for a game that never quite released. However, most of the time I enjoy playing music, I have around 5 ocarinas, 3 quenas, 2 zampo√±as, an Irish tin-whistle, and a few miscellaneous traditional flutes. I also quite enjoy just whistling and blowing on bottles. I've participated in musical ensembles with my ocarina and quena before, but few were recorded in good quality.
