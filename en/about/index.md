## Who am I?

<img id="about_img" src="/assets/2025-03-18_about.jpg" title="Claire Puppylove (aka icekler)" alt="Claire Puppylove (aka icekler)">

Local cryptid and suspected fox witch, I am Claire Puppylove (icekler), a Mexican non-binary transgender woman, visual artist and martial artist based in Osaka, Japan with an affinity for ink painting and calligraphy, as well as watercolors. Struggling with chronic illness and disabilities, I merge my cultural background and inspiration from Japanese and Chinese calligraphy, arts and mythology as well as medieval, Celtic and pagan influences to create a new style where each brush stroke displays an emotion. You can see my work here, or follow my most recent work on Bluesky ([@icekler.com](https://bsky.app/profile/icekler.com)) or on the Chinese platform Xiaohongshu ([@clairepuppylove](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/67860b72000000000801ef11)). 

I intend to de-stigmatize LGBTQ+, mental health issues, neurodiversity, intimate relationship style diversity and sex education. As an artist, I do visual art, music, martial arts, poetry, and so on. Lately I prefer to use ink and watercolors as my main medium, and I've begun to learn Chinese and Japanese calligraphy styles more seriously the last year. I go on social medias either by my moniker Claire Puppylove, or my artist website name Icekler (pronounced ee-sa-kler).

## What do I do?

Unable to work due to my chronic illness, during days I feel the most healthy, I like to do art and calligraphy. I mainly use ink on paper and watercolor, but I have used digital mediums in the past, such as digital painting, vector illustration designing, 3D modeling, 3D animation, 2D animation, etc. I also enjoy handcrafting, wood and stone carving, gold leafing and other manual arts.

Aside from the visual arts, I also do many martial arts. I've done Aikido my whole life, and I've practiced Karate, Kendo, Shorinji-Kenpo, Judo and Kyudo on a lesser amount. I am also interested in learning Xiaolin Kung Fu as well as Tai Chi and Baguazhang. 

I also have a wide range of musical tastes and hobbies. I like composing music in digital software. I have a few old compositions for a rock album that I left unfinished, and I did video game music for a game that never quite released. However, most of the time I enjoy playing music, I have around 5 ocarinas, 3 quenas, 2 zampoñas, an Irish tin-whistle, and a few miscellaneous traditional flutes. I also quite enjoy just whistling and blowing on bottles. I've participated in musical ensembles with my ocarina and quena before, but few were recorded in good quality.
